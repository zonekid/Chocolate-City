## What Happened 2 Chocolate City
WHAT HAPPENED 2 CHOCOLATE CITY (WH2CC) is a feature length documentary, exploring the rise and the decline of one of our nation's most prominent black communities through the narrative of three individuals. I created the website for the film as my first project ever so please excuse any outdated code etc. lol! Still proud of the way it turned out though. (Older project: Angular 1)
