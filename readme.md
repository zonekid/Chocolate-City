 My project 4 consisted of a website that I am creating for a local documentary film maker in the city.  The film is based on the gentrification process here in DC and how it effects the local community.  I was very intrigued and impressed with the footage and information that I seen so far and immediaitely wanted to help work on it.  
 Even though this project has no database or models, I looked at this project as a challenge for me because it is designed based and I felt my prior projects were lacking in style, which ironically I value most.  With that being said I wanted to be able to create a site that looked the par and could be something that I was proud to call mine at the end. I used angular to make it more responsive and faster rather than just html pages.
 User Stories
 Users will be able to scroll and click through diffrent links on two different navs to find information pertaining to the film.
 Users will be able to click on the pay pal button to donate money.
 Users will be able to click the join us button to join the list serv
 Users will be able to click submit to send contact information
Unsolved- This site is more designed focus than anything, so some things such as submitting user input(i.e donations, contact) doesn't neceesairily send info anywhere as of yet.  I still need to link the pay pal and the directors email to the contact form. I also want to be able to click on the gallery images and make the images pop up in a seperate window.  Also not all of the site links listed on the nav are done because it just would've been too much to do for the week in the timespan that I got the wireframe. The pages that I didnt do were pages that were thought of and sketched out by the director but not completed with content yet so I didn't want to waste time on it for the project specifically.  One last issue I had was with my side nav link.  I created a regular nav for all the pages and I also have a side nav bar on the "Director.html" as well as "contact.html"  For the side bar nav, even though they are linked to the same paths as the main nav bar, they wont work at all.   I don't know the reason why.
