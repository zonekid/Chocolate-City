    <p class="tae-name">Mignotae Kebede</p>
    <div class="bio">
      <p>
        A native Californian and graduate of The George Washington University (GWU), Mignotae Kebede is dedicated to exploring the intersections between creative expression and social change.
      </p>
      <p>
        Starting her career in international development at a young age, Mignotae founded the non-profit Lasting Impact For Ethiopia in 2007, lending her opportunity to serve as a member of the Clinton Global Initiative University for two years.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2010, Mignotae moved to Washington, D.C. to attend the Elliott School of International Affairs at George Washington University.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the fall of 2012, she advanced her scholastic experience in International Development and Anthropology by spending four months studying in Kigali, Rwanda. To fulfill an independent study requirement, Mignotae conducted ethnographic research, employing
        research methods that allowed her as the researcher to observe society from the participants’ and subjects’ points of view. She presented her findings on the Mainstreaming of Disability in Rwanda to government officials and NGO leaders following
        the completion of her program.
      </p>
      <p>
        After graduating with a Bachelors of Arts in International Affairs and Anthropology with a concentration in International Development, Mignotae served as the Development Manager at Life Pieces To Masterpieces (LPTM) in Northeast, Washington, DC. In her
        time leading the organizations’ Development Department, Mignotae developed a strategic fundraising plan, redesigned the organization’s primary earned revenue stream and worked diligently to shift organization efforts to capacity building, strategic
        alignment and organizational sustainability. It was through her work at LPTM, an organization serving African American boys and young men east of the Anacostia River, that she developed the concept for the forthcoming film What Happened 2 Chocolate
        City.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mignotae found herself experiencing the binary composition of Washington, D.C. as a transplant residing in a renovated unit in Columbia Heights, yet working in the districts most underserved communities just miles away. After months of experiencing the
        cities’ stark dichotomy, she began to unpack the implications of being a black gentrifier. Hit with an initial sentiment of guilt, she researched Chocolate City’s complex history attempting to understand it’s polarized social, political and economic
        climate. In pursuit to answer the underlying question, “what happened to Chocolate City?”, Mignotae is conducting ethnographic research on the evolution of the district and its relations with native Black Washingtonians. It is at the very intersection
        of creative expression and social change that Mignotae will bring to life her findings and explorative journey using film and varying mediums of visual and fine arts.
