			MigKeb Productions presents
			<span id="chocolate-city">What Happened 2 Chocolate City (WH2CC)</span> a feature length documentary, exploring the rise and decline of one of our nation’s most prominent Black communities through the narrative of three individuals. John, Mike, and Zarina, each represent a generational experience many Black Washingtonians faced over the past century.
			</p>

			<p class="third">
			For far too long, we have painted Washington DC with one brush and one narrative, depicting the city as a playground for political elites. What Happened 2 Chocolate City looks to unearth the multi-layered histories of Washington DC, the people that have been burdened by this American dream, and the disparities that exist between these two realities.   

			</p>

			<p class="second">
			By visually examining the repercussions of urban development and revitalization in the district, WH2CC will uncover the roots of Washington, DC, a district home to GoGo music, Mumbo Sauce, and legions of black artists and academics, and how they’ve come to be endangered.
