<h3>
What Happened 2 Chocolate City (WH2CC) explores the palpable demographic shift in our nation’s capital, providing a first hand look into the history and experiences of Black Washingtonians. For decades the White House and United States Capitol have operated neighboring communities plagued with generational poverty, violence, and lack of access to economic opportunity: a juxtaposition of the “protector” and the unprotected.
Washington, DC, once a majority-black city, has experienced a perpetual downward trend in its Black population over the past decade, simultaneously experiencing a significant population growth. Black Washingtonians have been a siloed community made invisible by the overt omnipresence of the federal government. The duality of the District’s identity has attributed to the systemic and economic displacement of its black communities. WH2CC explores this phenomenon through an intergenerational lens, following three characters from three generations.
By visually examining the repercussions of urban development and revitalization in the district, WH2CC will uncover the roots of Washington, DC, a district home to GoGo music, Mumbo Sauce, and legions of black artists and academics.
